            </div>
            <p>Due to my previous artistic experience I understand using a body and an action as designers methods. Despite the terms action and surface exist in seemingly disconnected worlds, I see the possibility to establish the connection and elaborate more on multidisciplinary link between -and coexistence of- performativity and graphic design.</p>

            <p> Following thesis introduces the research question: How does performativity influence the surface? Encouraged to answer this question, I examine the field of performance art, graphic design craftsmanship and vernacular action. As a result I demonstrate several examples the performativity is represented in contemporary post-digital culture and how it determines the production of its surface.</p>

            <p> We are used to present the graphic design as surface-centric praxis, surface-production tool and a strategy. In contradiction to that I try to step out of separated media constrains and through philosophy of affects (and affordances) I tend to establish new field of potential.</p>

            <p>This research covers the investigation and establishment of linking between action, body, designer and surface. It attempts to convince the reader, that design process is a kind of action, whereas we (designers) are responsible to be conscious about that fact. The text is a manifestation of emerging designer, his/her milieu and effort to position himself/herself into the world of democratized surface.</p></div>

                <p>Chapter 01</p>

            <p><em> “Our body is not in space like things; it inhabits or haunts space. It applies itself to space like
                a hand to an instrument; and when we wish to move about we do not move the body as we move an object. We
                transport it without instruments as if by magic, since it is ours and because through it we have direct
                access to space. For us the body is much more than an instrument or a means; it is our expression in the
                world, the visible form of our intentions. Even our most secret affective movements, those most deeply
                tied to the humoral infrastructure, help to shape our perception of things.”</em> —&nbspMaurice Merleau-Ponty<a
                    href="#1x0"> <sup>&nbsp0</sup></a></p>

            <p> To uderstand clearly my research question, I would like to introduce few definitions, concepts and
                theories. Performance, performativity and performative are hazy cross-media terms, which are often used
                throughout different disciplines and various, sometimes even contradictory uses. They became ubiquous
                and it looks that they provide kind of imaginary umbrella that covers recent cross-media work in time,
                in space and with bodies. When fine art, economy, linguistic and other disciplines may claim being
                performative, I think it's right time and it makes sense to start thinking of the discipline of
                communication design as performative as well.</p>

            <p>Performativity and performance are derived from the verb “to perform”, therefore they also among other
                specifics mean the capacity to execute an action, to “do well”. Paradoxically, performance can be
                understand in our capitalist glance as a quality of a commodity, as well as an action of performing an
                artistic work. To sing, to dance, to act in play, and to do performance art. So performance is the
                act*mm and performativity is related concept and method.<a href="#1xzz"><sup>&nbspzz</sup></a></p>

            <p>So the basic question is, what is performance? I consider performance as a practice that executes an
                action, that denotes the occurrence of an event, it incorporates time and it's connected with body or
                performer and an audience. The fine art theoretics Gregory Battcock and Robert Nickas define it is a
                field for action, an “extension of possibilities”.<a href="#1x1"> <sup>&nbsp1</sup></a> More
                specifically it's unique unrepeatable event, something that couldn't be easily mass-produced. According
                to Jean-Pierre Cometti, the perfomance practice is “opposed to the production of an object”<a
                        href="#1x2"> <sup>&nbsp2</sup></a>. Process became new material for artists. But still, and what
                makes it very contradictionary, this process is capable to create a work of art, a fetishized material
                memory. It's clear to conclude that performance works with the tension between material and the
                ephemeral, “between fragility of creation and existence”.<a href="#1x3"> <sup>&nbsp3</sup></a></p>

            <p> Where does performance take place? We can explain that on its relation to objects. For example we
                understand painting as a material work of art, it “takes place” in the physical object. Another example
                could be an essay, which “takes place” in the words or a song which “takes place” in sounds. But a
                performance is special, it “takes place” only in action, interaction, and relation. As more concete
                place we can imagine a theatre, street, or even computer screen. To addition to this, a book, a painting
                and other medias may be treated performatively and thus they become part of performance art, as it's
                explained by Richard Schechner.<a href="#1x4"> <sup>&nbsp4</sup></a> The paradox is that performance in
                its early stages separated itself from history of arts as an opposition to object-making practice, but
                through the sescond middle of 20th century it incorporated the creation of an art object back.</p>

            <p>One may ask: What are performative works and art pieces in our medialized world? How do we percieve them?
                Answer which is ambiguous can be found in text by Shannon Jackson, director of the Arts Research Center
                at the University of California, released by Walker Art Center: “They {performative art works} might be
                choreographed but are not quite “dance.” They are theater-like but not theater. Some might call such
                works performance art, and yet others would be unsure about the use of such a term…,”<a href="#1x5"
                                                                                                             name="b1x5"><sup>&nbsp5</sup></a>
                so we see, it might be still a bit confusing. Therefore, in this chapter, I will present few concepts of
                the term of performativity through the philosophy of language, social sciences and performance art
                theories. Starting with little glance at work of Austin, Goffman, Bateson, Derrida, Lyotard, and moving
                on to more recent debates surrounding the use of the concept by Butler, Deleuze and Fischer-Lichte.</p>
