            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>Due to my previous artistic experience I understand using
                the body and an action as a method of design. Despite the
                fact that the terms action and surface exist in seemingly
                disconnected worlds, I see the possibility to establish
                a connection and elaborate more on a multidisciplinary link
                between – and coexistence of – performativity and graphic
                design.</p>

            <p> The following thesis introduces the research question: How
                does performativity influence the surface? Encouraged to
                answer this question, I examine the field of performance
                art, graphic design craftsmanship and vernacular action.
                As a result I demonstrate several examples of performative
                acts in contemporary graphic design related visual culture
                and how it determines the production of its surface.</p>

            <p> We, designers, are used to presenting graphic design as
                a surface‑centric practice, the way of surface production.
                In addition to this, I try to step out of separated media constrains
                and tend to establish a new field of potential through
                identifying performative components in graphic design processes
                and results.</p>

            <p>This research covers the investigation and establishment
                of links between action, body, designer and surface. It attempts
                to convince the reader, that surface production could be an action, happening, or chance‑driven act. Therefore
                the text introduces necessary theoretical, philosophical
                and historical backgrounds of performance art.</p>

            <p>The narrative covers examples from Leonardo da Vinci
                through Modernists, Post‑War Expressionists and Andy
                Warhol to recent work by Hito Steyerl. It also presents
                graphic designers working with action in their design process.
                For example Sister Corita Kent’s activism, Stefan Sagmeister
                with his involvement of the body and nomadism, the
                conceptual approach of Czech designer Petr Babák, Maki
                Suzuki with his excitement “to do”, ephemeral surfaces and
                the unforgettable events of Cox and Grusenmeyer, Moniker
                with their Conditional Design happenings towards surface
                and Auto Italia’s identity of interactive assistant.</p>

            <p>Finally, the text explains why the contemporary form of labour
                - Sven Lütticken’s concept of general performance - is
                so important. This thesis is a manifestation of the emerging
                designer, his/her milieu and effort to position himself/herself
                into the world of democratized surface production.</p>

            <h1>Context and Fascination</h1>
            <p>I would like to start with a brief introduction of my personal
                history. As a child I became fascinated by theatre performances
                and happenings because of my artistic family’s
                background. This later became the reason why I decided
                to study Fine Arts. At that time art, especially performance,
                was a carefree game for me; never critical and always
                super‑naive. Consequently I started to document my actions
                in the form of small zines and posters. To confess,
                I was only a weirdo presenting a completely redesigned
                portfolio each semester.</p>
            <p>Later on, I decided to concentrate more on promotion and
                creating the visual identities of the small gallery I curated
                at that time. Naturally, those first design results were not
                satisfying. The curiosity to gain a deeper understanding and
                the desire to be “a professional” led me to apply to study
                graphic design at KABK. Immediately after the academic
                year’s kick off I discovered that the discipline’s borders are
                fluid and full of possible fields for examination and extension.
                So I started appropriating the language and production
                modes I had learned in Fine Arts.</p>
            <p>I understand Dutch design education is research based,
                focused on the future, emerging technologies and responsibility.
                But the most fascinating thing is the effort to connect
                the individual abilities, needs and experiences with the
                realm of graphic design. So I decided to write this thesis as
                a synthesis of my previous artistic experience and design
                education.</p>
            <h1>Structure guide</h1>
            <p>I present the thesis structured in two sections. The first section
                contains two chapters, Understanding Performance
                and Surface (1st chapter) and Theoretical Background of
                Performance (2nd chapter). The second section is composed
                of three chapters chronologically presenting historical
                and contemporary examples of performance art and
                graphic design using action.</p>
            <p>The title of the first chapter – Understanding Performance
                and Surface – already indicates that the chapter provides
                fundamental information to gain orientation in specific terminology.
                I explain the meaning of Lütticken’s general performance
                and its capacity to redefine labour, Battcock’s and
                Nicka’s field of action and Schechner’s art redirection from
                object‑making practice. Then I look closely at the term surface.
                I present Metahaven’s key ideas upon its capacity to
                transform values and my own cloud metaphor. After this
                chapter the reader understands the difference between banana
                peel, banknote and computer screen in terms of surface,
                as well as that performance consists of a few unique
                ingredients: chance, action, eventness, space, time and
                bodies.</p>
            <p>Theories of speech act, language‑games, theatre metaphor,
                the performative turn of the 1960s, defamiliarization
                and Deleuzian philosophy of affects are all introduced in the
                second chapter: Theoretical Background of Performance. It
                begins with a glance at performativity through the theories
                of Austin, Derrida, Lyotard, Goffman and moving on to more
                recent debates surrounding the use of the concept of performance
                by Fischer‑
                Lichte, Butler, Bateson, and also with
                a little resurrection of theories by Shklovsky, escalating in
                Deleuze’s and Guattari’s philosophical approach towards
                affect.</p>
            <p>The narrative of the second section of Action to Surface
                is organized chronologically in the realm of The Gutenberg’s
                Galaxy. It begins with Renaissance man Leonardo
                da Vinci who used performance as a ground for testing new
                ideas. The third chapter, however, continues with a leap –
                displacing the reader directly into the revolutionary era of
                the avant-gardes. From the Dadaist magical form of activating
                the audience, through Duchamp’s performative act,
                Schlemmer’s stage theory, Teige’s performed alphabet to
                the post‑war
                era of Performative Turn, where the action
                emerged as a new medium of the form of art and activism
                – Klein, Cage, Kaprow, Brecht, Beuys, Corita Kent and The
                Provo..</p>
            <p>Performativity in The Post‑Gutenberg
                Galaxy is the title of the
                fourth chapter where the narrative of selected historical examples
                continues. It starts with Warhol’s transfer of performativity
                from artist to designer and its commodification. It also shows
                artworks connecting action with cryptography, graphic signs,
                typography and calligraphy – de Cointet, Paik, Holzer, Stelarc.
                And in return it presents designers inspired by conceptual and
                The second section of the thesis ends with the fifth chapter
                entitled The Age of Democratized Surface Production. This
                chapter looks at the democratization of design and presents
                performance as a possible approach of how designers
                may face it. Contemporary design projects incorporating
                action and participation are introduced here. For example
                Åbäke’s performative survey into graphic medium presentation,
                Cox & Grusenmeyer’s design‑
                wise happenings, live
                handwriting as a form of the craftsmanship by Letman, Moniker’s
                projects exploring surface created during happenings
                and other projects done by artists and designers. The last
                chapter shows how designers execute their processes as
                actions and consciously became performers.</p>
            <p>Both sections, the theoretical one as well as examples of
                different approaches towards performative surface production,
                serve as a basis for my conclusion. This thesis answers
                the research question by proving that surface production is
                more and more oriented towards actions, happenings and
                events to catch the viewer’s attention.</p>

            <h1>Performance and Performativity</h1>
            <p><em>“Our body is not in space like things; it inhabits or haunts space. It applies
                itself to space like a hand to an instrument; and when we wish to
                move about we do not move the body as we move an object. We transport
                it without instruments as if by magic, since it is ours and because
                through it we have direct access to space. For us the body is much
                more than an instrument or a means; it is our expression in the world,
                the visible form of our intentions.”</em><br>
                — Maurice Merleau‑Ponty<a href="#1x1" class="refnote" name="t1x1">1</a></p>

            <p>To clearly understand my research question, I would like
                to introduce concepts and theories of performativity. Performance
                and performativity are hazy cross‑media
                terms,
                which are often used throughout different disciplines and
                various, sometimes even contradictory uses. They became
                ubiquitous and it looks that they provide a kind of imaginary
                umbrella that covers recent cross‑media
                work in time, in
                space and with bodies. When fine art, economy, linguistic
                and other disciplines may claim performativity, I feel it’s the
                right time and that it makes sense to start thinking of the
                discipline of graphic design as performative as well.</p>
            <p>Performativity and performance are derived from the verb
                “to perform”, therefore they also, among other specificities
                mean the capacity to execute an action, to do well.
                Paradoxically, performance can be understood in our capitalist
                view as a quality of a commodity, as well as an action
                of performing an artistic work. A discovery for me is that
                performance has extended meanings, especially in contemporary
                economy and its labor regimes. According to the essay
                General Performance<a href="#1x2" class="refnote" name="t1x2">2</a> by Sven Lütticken performance
                refers to <em>“quasi‑theatrical self‑presentation”</em>
                where everybody
                does his/her job by performing it (which I further investigate
                as a theatre metaphor in the second chapter) but also
                what’s more fascinating is that it redefines the work itself.</p>
            <p>The Performative turn of art in the 1960’s indicated not only
                an art‑
                revolt but also the birth of a new form of labor - general
                performance. That means how Western societies perceive,
                execute and give value to work has changed since
                then. Automation of production made human labor needless
                and transformed it into occupation. Work leads to an end
                product, however occupation is an activity that doesn’t intend
                an end, rather a service or engagement. Everybody is
                nowadays constantly occupied and unable to distinguish
                between performance and life or working hours and free
                time; it is all mixed up together. Flexible working hours,
                overused especially in arts and design, signal that immaterial
                labor became Lütticken’s general performance. Time
                was made into currency, where quality is emphasized over quantity.
                I, as a designer, not only design things, but I often
                visit or take part at various design‑
                related events, exhibition
                openings, symposiums, and talks and I don’t perceive it as
                leisure time, that’s my investment into potential future projects,
                future clients and collaborations. Being social is part of
                my self‑
                presenting performance, it’s part of my occupation.</p>
            <p>Let’s return from economy back to art and design to ask
                what is performance there? For me it is a practice that executes
                an action, that denotes the occurrence of an event,
                it incorporates space, time and it’s connected with a performing
                body and an audience. To sing, to dance, to act in
                a play, and to do performance art. So performance is the
                act or activity and <em>“performativity is its essence, nature and
                quality”</em><a href="#1x3" class="refnote" name="t1x3">3</a>
                thus I understand performativity also as a concept
                and method of performance. The fine art theoreticians
                Gregory Battcock and Robert Nickas define it as a field for
                action, an <em>“extension of possibilities”</em>.
                <a href="#1x4" class="refnote" name="t1x4">4</a>
                More specifically it’s a unique unrepeatable event, something that couldn’t be
                easily mass‑produced. According to Jean‑
                Pierre Cometti, the
                performance practice is <em>“opposed to the production of an
                object”</em><a href="#1x5" class="refnote" name="t1x5">5</a>.
                Process became new material for artists. But still,
                and what makes it very contradictory, is that this process is
                capable of creating a work of art, a fetishized material memory.
                It’s clear to conclude that performance works with the tension between material and the ephemeral, between
                unexpectedness of creation and fragility of being.</p>
            <p>Choreographer and curator Bruno Listopad emphasizes
                chance as a key aspect - the sparkle - of performance. Bruno,
                inspired among many things by Deleuzian philosophy,
                circulation of affect and Google Earth extends the field of
                theatre, design and dance. He describes himself as a post‑choreographic
                app. And in my eyes, his function as an app
                is to activate and emancipate the audience, but also the
                performer via the creative act. For Bruno, this creative act
                examines actualisations of a potential where relations play
                an important role. Therefore he describes performance as
                <em>“a different level of exchange”</em>
                <a href="#1x6" class="refnote" name="t1x6">7</a>.</p>
            <p>Where does performance take place? Let’s explain this
                through its relationship to objects. For example I understand
                painting as a materialized work of art, it takes place
                in the physical object. Another example could be an essay,
                which takes place in the words or a song which happens in
                sounds. But a performance is special, it takes place only in
                action, interaction, and relation. More specifically in theatre,
                on the street, or even on a computer screen - an active surface.
                In addition to this, a book, a painting and other medias
                may be treated performatively and thus they become part of performance, as it’s explained
                by Richard Schechner<a href="#1x7" class="refnote" name="t1x7">7</a>. The
                paradox is that performance art in its early stages separated
                itself from history of arts as an opposition to object‑
                making practice, but through the second half of the 20th century it
                incorporated the creation of the art object again.</p>
            <p>This makes me think - what are performative works and art
                pieces in our medialized world? How do we perceive them?
                I found an ambiguous answer in Shannon Jackson’s text
                published by Walker Art Center: <em>“They (performative art
                works) might be choreographed but are not quite ‘dance.’
                They are theater‑like
                but not theater. Some might call such
                works performance art, and yet others would be unsure
                about the use of such a term…”</em><a href="#1x8" class="refnote" name="t1x8">8</a>. This proves to me, that
                it might be still a bit confusing, the term performance is
                slippery even when I try to define its context. Therefore, in
                the second chapter, I focus on performativity through the
                philosophy of language, social sciences and performance
                art theories.</p>

            <h1>Surface</h1>

            <p><em>“Graphic designers are in fact producers of surfaces, millions of them.”</em>
                — Andrew Blauvelt<a href="#1x9" class="refnote" name="t1x9">9</a></p>
            <p>There are many ways how to approach the definition of surface.
                Traditionally the surface is understood to be hiding,
                covering what is behind. The surface is assumed to be the
                thin border between object and outside, the flat peel wrapping
                the volume. Contradictory to this I realized that flatness
                of surface is not a quality with the potential for contemporary
                designers. On top of that I assume flatness is more the
                issue of a viewer’s distance than the surface’s essential
                property. I would like to explain this through the metaphor
                of clouds. When we look at clouds, we perceive them as flat
                textures trudging the sky. But getting closer in a plane we
                realize they are volumes. Similarly the development of information
                technologies allowed us to discover that the surface
                is not Gutenberg’s flatland anymore.</p>
            <p>Due to technology evolution there are now three recognizable
                types of surface. The first type is surface connected to
                its material as a border with a potential of relations with the
                surroundings, when simultaneously it’s a place to show information.
                That natural surface is, for example, human skin
                or a banana peel and we can call it former surface. The second
                one, according to Amsterdam based speculative design studio Metahaven
                <a href="#1x10" class="refnote" name="t1x10">10</a> is mute or passive surface, which has
                the capacity to transform values and it is defined as a place
                where the material properties of its material don’t have to
                correspond to its information properties. This information
                increases the value of the material. For example money or
                credit cards are made of paper‑
                textile material or plastic,
                but we, as a society, agreed on the certain quality it has. The
                last type would be called communicative or active surface.
                This surface is <em>“classified by its capacity to reveal and open
                up doorways to virtual worlds.”</em><a href="#1x11"class="refnote" name="t1x11">11</a> It could be a smartphone or computer
                screen, display of wearables, iPads and Kindles. <em>“Active surfaces are
                inhabited by worlds in worlds”.</em><a href="#1x12" class="refnote" name="t1x12">12</a></p>
            <p>Surface evolution caused design to now be defined as the
                management and creation of virtual qualities binded to
                materials - multifunctional objects, gadgets which communicate
                and display information through their screens. For
                example the phone as a surface has the capacity to perform
                with its user and organize social relations and informations
                for him/her.<a href="#1x13" class="refnote" name="t1x13">13</a> But what makes active surfaces extraordinary
                is that they produce production (surface produces action).
                Consumption has become a force to produce, a force
                that creates other needs. Contemporary surface is waiting
                for its user full of placeholders and default settings, fake
                friends, default images or avatars, even with default text
                posts in the form of <em>lorem ipsum</em>. This surface needs user‑generated
                content - an action or performance - to become
                more personal and friendly. Nowadays content is generated
                effortlessly and in an extremely pleasant way, the time when
                activities required some physical endeavour is gone. It’s so
                easy to take and upload photographs, measure burned calories,
                share the data with friends, search find and shop or
                even write to people who are thousands of kilometers far
                away.</p>
            <p>As passive surface can be produced by labour or machines,
                the active one needs to stimulate users to perform to be
                created. Active surface stimulates us to perform action,
                to accept the role - a user, administrator - which produces
                surface itself, which then as in the cycle becomes a self‑perpetuating
                system. For example users (they perform
                a role) have to fill in information (action) to their social media
                profiles (place) by uploading pictures and writing statuses
                for their friends (audience). So these performances happen
                in virtual space by movement of a cursor and updating
                profiles as well as in our physical world by mouse clicking.
                Therefore the existence of performance is essential for the
                production of active performance‑
                surface machine<a href="#1x14" class="refnote" name="t1x14">14</a>.</p>

        <div class="subchapter">
            <p>In this chapter I follow different subsequent performance
                theories from separate gesture or speech act, through language
                game to the understanding it as a part of wider system
                or complex interaction and finally to Deleuzian affect.</p>

            <h1>Speech Act</h1>
            <p>In 1960’s, at the same time when performance art step out
                of the conformist traditional art world, John L. Austin pragmatically
                rethought the nature of words. To understand his
                core idea of the performative utterance one has to accept,
                that saying something is also doing something. Austin
                claimed the performative speech act could not be reduced
                only to constative utterances that provide us description
                of the world such as the statement: <em>“It’s a sunny day”</em>.
                In
                contrast performative act forces its limits by projecting an
                intention - a task. Therefore it can be extended as a mode of
                action. Let’s take for example Austin’s famous marriage act
                phrase <em>“I do”</em>, which goes beyond reporting because it contains
                acting. Therefore correct marriage procedure - a ritual
                - makes this statement valid. According to his influential
                book How To do Things with Words, performative utterances

                <p>Austin’s linguistic theory can be understood as a revolutionary
                    shift in the theory of communication. That particular approach to performativity was further extended by French
                    post‑
                    structuralist philosophers, Jacques Derrida and Jean‑François
                    Lyotard. In essay Signature Event Contex<a href="#2x2"class="refnote" name="t2x2">2</a> Derrida
                    introduced idea of language‑
                    text relations and developed
                    inspiring method of deconstruction, while Lyotard was
                    interested in question: where does performativity emerge?
                    That led him to investigation of the role of the language
                    games in society. The language‑
                    games give the language
                    its meaning. Term was firstly introduced by Ludwig Wittgenstein
                    and brought into the prominence the fact that <em>“speaking
                    of language is part of an activity, or a form of life.”</em>
                    <a href="#2x3" class="refnote" name="t2x3">3</a> To
                    say something - to make an utterance - is similar to make
                    a move in a game. Lyotard extended Austin’s definitions of
                    performative utterances and developed three principles:
                    that statement is valid by a contract between players of the
                    language game, there must be rules and every utterance is
                    equal to the move in game</p>

                <h1>Transformative Situation</h1>

                <p>American social theorist Ervin Goffman provided a unique
                    perspective on the idea of self and society. He was interested
                    in staging, relationships and question how performativity
                    happens. According to Goffman, not only an actor or a performance
                    artist, but every individual; a policeman, a hotel
                    stuff, a violinist, a Vogue model; is trying to persuade others
                    to believe in their character. To do this they need to deliver
                    a performance, by which he means <em>“all the activity of an
                    individual which occurs during a period…before a set of observers
                    and which has some influence on the observers”</em>
                    <a href="#2x5" class="refnote" name="t2x5">5</a>.
                    This metaphor of social life as a theater is broadly understood
                    as <em>“conceptual framework for interaction analysis”.</em>
                    <a href="#2x6" class="refnote" name="t2x6">6</a>
                    It describes conditions of producing reality within social
                    exchange. It covers setting of a whole situation, a place (theatre
                    stage, or for example a hotel), actors (not only theater
                    actors as mentioned above) and their audience (which is
                    possibly also in a role). Based on this, Goffman argued the
                    theatre metaphor is what social life is like, performativity is
                    made possible through the framing of the social scene.</p>
                <p>When I understand the performance in Deleuzian terms
                    as capacity to transform situation, I think it’s more than
                    appropriate to present the ideas of theatre historian -
                    Erika Fisher‑Lichte. She writes about the Performative turn
                    of the 1960’s and breaks down this phenomenon into its
                    components to explore its transformative and interactive
                    powers. She explains that live performance is shaped
                    by interaction between performer and spectator, where
                    anything can happen.<a href="#2x7" class="refnote" name="t2x7">7</a> Marvin Carlson in introduction to
                    Fisher‑
                    Lichte’s book describes the Performative turn in
                    fine arts as a historical shift from production of art object to
                    production of event.<a href="#2x8" class="refnote" name="t2x8">8</a>
                    For Formalists like Shklovsky, however,
                    the ordinary was found in the materiality of the world
                    (objects); while for Fisher‑
                    Lichte it is the experience of the
                    ever‑
                    evolving dynamics of being in that world (event, happening)
                    - as is described in the Defamiliarization essay.</p>
                <p>Fisher‑
                    Lichte goes further in theory of performance and
                    elaborates on its immanent connection with culture: <em>“if not
                    in the first place, performance. It can hardly be overlooked
                    to what an extent culture is brought forth as and in performances
                    – not only in performances of the different arts but
                    also, and foremost in performances of rituals, festivals, political
                    rallies, sport competitions, games, fashion shows and
                    the like – performances which, in a mediatized form, reach
                    out to millions of people.”</em><a href="#2x9" class="refnote" name="t2x9">9</a></p>
                <p>I’ve selected few arguments from Erika Fisher’s Lichte
                    text Culture as Performance: 1) A performance comes into
                    being by the bodily co‑
                    presence of actors and spectators, by their encounter and interaction. 2) What happens in performances,
                    is temporary and ephemeral. 3) Performances
                    are characterized by their eventness. At the end of her
                    text she briefly explains that reproductible performances
                    mediated through film, television, video, design and internet,
                    are also included in broader concept of performativity,
                    however they are not included in bodily co‑
                    presence of
                    performers and spectators.<a href="#2x10" class="refnote" name="t2x10">10</a></p>
                <p>Judith Butler understands performativity in wider meaning
                    - as our everyday life roles. Her theory of performativity
                    specifically addresses the process in which gender and
                    identity are created. She explained complex ideas about
                    performativity and power to reject/create normative rules.
                    Nothing ever exists outside of the power and power is always
                    relation. She wrote about identity which is a process
                    of construction, a consequence of historical and behavioral
                    norms within larger social contexts. <em>“Identity is performatively
                    constituted.”</em><a href="#2x11" class="refnote" name="t2x11">11</a> I understand that Butler sees
                    performative practices as transformative components of
                    our everyday life. According to Sara Salih, a theoretician
                    who made further readings of Butler’s Gender Trouble
                    a <em>“gender is not something one is, it is something one
                    does, an act, or more precisely, a sequence of acts.”</em>
                    <a href="#2x12" class="refnote" name="t2x12">12</a></p>
            <p>In the book, Ecology of Mind, Gregory Bateson explained
                actions in terms of being performative within the complex
                system which they are part of. <a href="#2x13" class="refnote" name="t2x13">13</a>
                I understand this system
                as human interactions, relations and reactions to patterns.
                <a href="#2x14" class="refnote" name="t2x14">14</a> Bateson’s patterns are acts of human perception and
                respond to the world which is in the process of constant
                change - a flow of life.</p>
                <h1>Power to affect</h1>
                <p>Talking about Butler I have to present the following ideas of
                    Gilles Deleuze, who formed a very complex and sometimes
                    almost unintelligible philosophy known as New Materialism.
                    He was inspired among many others by Butler’s work. In
                    his Logic of Sense we find him concerned with the transformative
                    (performative) potential of bodies and language.
                    <a href="#2x15" class="refnote" name="t2x15">15</a>
                    In Thousand Plateaus, collaboratively written with psychoanalyst
                    Félix Guattari, they rephrased Austinian distinction
                    between the performative, as that which one does by saying
                    it (swearing, naming) and the illocutionary, as that which one
                    does in speaking (questions, promises, commands).
                    <a href="#2x16" class="refnote" name="t2x16">16</a> They
                    went further, when describing the relation between the act
                    and the statement as immanent or inseparable: <em>“each statement
                    accomplishes an act and the act is accomplished in
                    the statement.”</em>
                    <a href="#2x17" class="refnote" name="t2x17">17</a> They name this statement‑
                    acts.</p>
                <p>In another branch of New Materialism, called philosophy
                    of affects Deleuze demonstrated his theory on performativity
                    and bodies through examples of cinema and movies
                    (moving images). Construing that art (in this case images)
                    and design have special capacity to affect the audience
                    and also to be affected, we may understand his theory as
                    considering the performance as expression‑
                    event of affect.
                    Affect he presents is beyond language, binary structures as
                    reality/illusion, subject/object, and ideology. Therefore the
                    body becomes <em>“site where the affective event takes place,
                    in either its productive or receptive modalities, or more likely,
                    in both simultaneously.”</em>
                    <a href="#2x18" class="refnote" name="t2x18">18</a>
                    Elena del Rio, author of the
                    book Powers of Affection is, after reading and incorporating
                    Deleuzian philosophy, concerned with the performative dimension
                    of bodies, especially in cinema. Here the bodies
                    of actors are “doers, generators producers, performers of
                    worlds, of sensations and affects.” According to her, performance
                    has the power to de-form and trans-form. Performativity
                    is also a way of social construction of identity, which
                    in my opinion correlates with Butler and the art theories of
                    Russian Formalists.</p>
                <p>One thing is certain, though, according to Shklovsky’s essay
                    Art as Device, art and design have strong affective power
                    due to defamiliarization of what they are made of. The ability
                    of art and design <em>“is to make objects unfamiliar”.</em>
                    <a href="#2x19" class="refnote" name="t2x19">19</a> In
                    other words, the purpose of fine art and design is to communicate
                    the sensation of things as they are perceived and
                    not as they are known. According to Shklovsky the author
                    has responsibility to manipulate formal elements in order
                    to transform common everyday language into defamiliarized
                    one. American writer, Audrey Watters explains Formalist
                    <em>“act of creative deformation restores sharpness to our
                    perception, giving “density” to the world around us.”</em>
                    <a href="#2x20" class="refnote" name="t2x20">20</a> Excellent example could be found in Duchamp’s work, which
                    is described in the third chapter.</p>
                <p>I would like to end this chapter with act of living. I understand
                    it as constantly re‑
                    inventing, bringing ideas and actions
                    together, contributing to the being‑
                    together web of relations;
                    to Deleuzian assamblage. Deleuze’s interest can be
                    found in bodily capacity to make us think of the unthought.
                    Moreover bodies have active power to affect and also
                    passive power to be affected.  <a href="#2x21" class="refnote" name="t2x21">21</a>
                    To summarize this, I can
                    conclude that affects are thus powers of body while performance
                    is the bridge of these powers of bodies out through
                    action, relation and transformation.</p>

    <div class="subchapter">

        <p>To understand the term Gutenberg Galaxy I have to start
            in 1962, when media theorist Marshall McLuhan analyzed
            the effect of mass media and technologies on culture in
            his book The Gutenberg Galaxy
            <a href="#3x1" class="refnote" name="t3x1">1</a>. For a duration of 107
            chapters readers are invited to an historical ride from pre‑alphabetical
            tribal humankind to the electronic age. As
            I understand the message of McLuhan’s book, the invention
            of typography and print in 1436 gave birth to first mass
            production. It brought the visual into dominance over the
            oral - the significance of objects over events. Therefore the
            Performative turn of the 1960’s was, among other aspects
            derived from the arising importance of communication independent
            from printed text, which turned attention back
            to the ignored verbality of language and the eventness.
            Jose A. Sanchez describes this as the abandonment of the
            Gutenberg Galaxy <a href="#3x2" class="refnote" name="t3x2">2</a>.</p>

        <p> In what follows, I explore the frames of reality‑
            making contexts
            of performativity within its briefly examined history.
            I reflect around selected artworks, theatreworks and designworks
            that span the time of Renaissance to the present day.</p>

        <h1>Performance as a Testing Ground for New Design Ideas</h1>

        <p> The most significant predecessors of performance art can
            be found in the Italian Renaissance. During 15th century,
            performance served as a testing ground for new ideas.
            Architects and scenographers designed triumphal processions
            and planned elaborate celebrations for the rich elites
            of that time. According to that fact I assume, that already six
            hundred years ago, artists and inventors used performance
            with its transformative potential to create famous artworks
            capable of moving their audience which are still remarkable
            today
            <a href="#3x3" class="refnote" name="t3x3">3</a>.</p>

        <p>Leonardo da Vinci had all the hallmarks of the Renaissance
            man, a polymath, whose expertise spanned a multiplicity
            of talents, creative force and vision. He became a legend
            already during his life and perfected various techniques to
            produce fantastic effects. A stunning example would be how
            he depicted Pythagorean music of spheres:
            <em>“The guests now streamed into the Sala del giuoco alla
            pala, which had been arranged for the representation of
            the Paradiso, by Leonardo da Vinci, the Court mechanician.
            Then a train of powder exploded, and crystalline globes, like
            planets, were seen disposed in a circle, filled with water, and
            illumined by a myriad of living fires sparkling with rainbow
            colours.”</em><a href="#3x4" class="refnote" name="t3x4">4</a></p>
        <p>In contrary to Modernists and the 1960’s views of performance
            as a tendency towards dematerialization, 15th century
            performativity was highly material. These fashions of
            object‑driven vs. immaterial‑driven performative production
            have alternated ever since.</p>

        <h1>The Performative Act as a Catalyst of Art Revolution</h1>
        <p>In the first decade of the 20th century the avant‑
            garde
            emerged in fine arts. Modern art was at that time strongly
            influenced by technological innovation, the horrors of World
            War I and theories of space and time by Albert Einstein. According
            to RoseLee Goldberg the history of performance
            art can be seen as a series of waves, Futurists, Dadaists,
            Constructivists, Surrealists and Abstract Expressionists who
            challenged traditional forms of art and experimented towards
            conceptual ideas. They used performativity as a catalyst
            for change, an endless mediator and a way of animating
            formal ideas.<a href="#3x5" class="refnote" name="t3x5">5</a>
            At that time, artists criticized their own discipline,
            attempted to resolve problematic issues and break
            down conventional categories, especially via performance.
            Due to Modernist’s experiments the graphic design discipline,
            as we know it, was born.</p>
        <p>In the first decade of the 19th century avant‑
            garde artists,
            intellectuals and the first graphic designers met together,
            read poetry and shared their excitement. Marinetti and the
            Futurists, obsessed with developments in technology, began
            with manifestos and performances <em>“against what they
            branded as the past‑
            loving art of the museum”</em><a href="#3x6" class="refnote" name="t3x6">6</a> before
            finding their ground in materialized art objects; painting and
            sculpture. In their designs, especially to visualize poems,
            Futurists started to play with mixed typefaces in unbridled
            compositions, whitespace and diagonals.
            <a href="#3x7" class="refnote" name="t3x7">7</a></p>
        <p>Before Zürich Dadaists created art objects, they were
            poets and cabaret artists interested in the element of
            chance. Dadaists experimented with graphic design and
            typography by using photomontage, accidents and automatic
            drawings. In 1918 Tristan Tzara wrote instructions on
            how to make an accidental poem.
            <a href="#3x8" class="refnote" name="t3x8">8</a> and Hans Arp with his
            wife designed many abstract puppets. Toys became performative
            objects used in a cabaret, but I assume they are
            also the embodiment of a fascination with the realm of the
            childlike. On the account of childlike Hugo Ball, cabaret
            Voltaire performer, wrote that the aim of the Dadaists was
            to: <em>“surpass oneself in naiveté and childishness.”</em>
            <a href="#3x9" class="refnote" name="t3x9">9</a> During
            his poetry experiments Ball used performance as a magical
            form of manifestation, to activate relationship between
            himself and the audience.</p>
        <p>Another modernist‑
            superhero, Marcel Duchamp, helped to
            articulate through his ready‑
            mades the crisis of the artistic
            object in the field of visual arts <a href="#3x10" class="refnote" name="t3x10">10</a>.
            The act of exhibiting and
            signing an everyday object was clearly a performative act.
            In Duchamp’s famous Fountain, I observe his interest in displacing
            the commercial product out of its context through
            a performative act of giving a special value to it - by the signature.
            This is an excellent example of the affective power
            of defamiliarization, as it is described in the second chapter.
            Moreover Duchamp used action enriched with gimmick to
            create a poster for the French Chess Championship
            <a href="#3x11" class="refnote" name="t3x1">11</a>, one
            of the biggest conceptual and visual riddles ever. In particular,
            it’s a poster designed by action, spiced up with optical
            tricks. Duchamp himself was a chess champion.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Bauhaus school, under the direction of Walter
            Gropius, opened its classrooms in Weimar in 1919. Bauhaus
            as a Cathedral of Socialism strove to re‑
            establish <em>“unity
            between the areas of artistic and technical production,
            which had been separated by emerging industrial production”</em>
            <a href="#3x12" class="refnote" name="t3x12">12</a>,
            which led to the idea of a total artwork, synthesis
            of the arts and their construction called Gesamtkunstwerk.
            Richard Wagner, German composer of operas coined the
            term Gesamtkunstwerk as an ideal of unifying all works of
            art via the theatre and performance; a collective total artwork
            of the future.</p>
        <p>The first course in performance, ever given in an art school,
            was opened in 1921 at Bauhaus; headed by expressionist
            Lothar Schreyer. Students from all departments wearing
            geometric full‑
            body masks participated in this Stage Workshop
            experiment <em>“to explore issues related to the language
            of form”</em><a href="#3x13" class="refnote" name="t3x13">13</a>. Later Oskar Schlemmer, painter and choreographer
            took over its direction and developed his Stage Theory of Body Movements in Space
            <a href="#3x14" class="refnote" name="t3x14">14</a> When the school moved to
            Dessau, Schlemmer organized a huge opening party called
            Metallic Festival. This event included distinctively designed
            invitations, performances in silver costumes and decorated
            rooms in metal. From photographs I guess Bauhaus
            parties gave a free rein to students to show their creativity
            and design invention, providing opportunities to produce
            remarkable invitations, posters, costumes and decorations.
            Besides that, Bauhaus introduced a new manner of stage
            and theatre practice, while at the same time graphic design
            pedagogy began to form and take shape.</p>
        <p>Let’s move to Prague, where in 1926 Surrealist Karel Teige,
            a key figure of the Czech avant‑
            garde movement Devětsil
            (Nine Forces), designed an elegant photomontage alphabet.
            What I find unique is that the entire alphabet was
            performed by a ballet dancer. Every letter is expressed;
            performed. Each movement was choreographed to create
            a visual counterpoint of typography. Therefore it is performative
            surface. Teige was not only a great typographer
            and graphic artist, but also editor, designer and critic. He
            shared the same belief in power of functionalism as the
            second Bauhaus director, his friend Hannes Meyer. Unfortunately
            Teige was silenced and his work banned by the
            Communists in the late 1940s.</p>

        <h1>Medium of Action</h1>
        <p>By the end of World War II, television as a mass medium
            began to play a major role in everyday life and artistic performance
            had clearly emerged as a medium itself. In terms of
            looking for post‑war
            performativity it is necessary to mention
            the action painter Jackson Pollock, author of abstract drip
            paintings<a href="#3x15" class="refnote" name="t3x15">15</a> and pioneer of European performance art, Yves
            Klein with his investigations into colour and immateriality.
            Yves Klein developed the intense colour IKB – International
            Klein Blue, similar to contemporary primary digital Blue colour,
            widely used by internet artists and designers. IKB was
            demonstrated during numerous salons in which spectators
            were invited to watch nude women covered by the famous
            blue, leaving imprints on huge canvases and simultaneously
            becoming Klein’s living paintbrushes.
            <a href="#3x16" class="refnote" name="t3x16">16</a> Pollock and Klein
            remind me that surface can be an intended result of action
            and chance.</p>
        <p>There is similar redirection towards action and gesture at
            the progressive American Black Mountain College, an influential
            avant‑
            garde school on the post‑war
            art scene and
            pop culture. This is where the Untitled Event, a multi-layered
            multimedia experiment<a href="#3x17" class="refnote" name="t3x17">17</a>
            involving poetry, music and
            dance, inspired by Bauhaus performances was introduced
            to the artworld in 1952. In particular, its authors John Cage,
            Robert Rauschenberg and Merce Cunningham proclaimed the first
            prototypical happening. Happenings were left to
            chance events with minimal script, abandoning the traditional
            concept of stage-
            audience, involving the audience
            into the co-
            creating of an event. Cage’s student, Allan
            Kaprow brought the term happening<a href="#3x18" class="refnote" name="t3x18">18</a>
            to fame. I understand
            happenings as unstructured participatory events that
            just happen without any hierarchy between the artist and
            viewers. Such viewers aren’t only looking at the piece, but
            interacting with it, becoming part of it. Kaprow developed his
            practice called activities by studying ordinary life as a form
            of artistic adventure, making the boundaries of art and life
            less distinct.</p>
        <p>Recognizing Kaprow’s desire to lose structure, improvisation,
            and non‑
            theater places of happenings, renewed
            through the usage of other medias such as films and
            recorded music, the neo‑
            dadaist movement well‑
            known
            as Fluxus emerged. During the early 1960’s George Maciunas,
            its founder, along with Joseph Beuys, Yoko Ono, Nam
            June Paik, Ay‑
            O, George Brecht and other fine artists contributed
            revolutionarily to performance, installation and
            video art.<a href="#3x19" class="refnote" name="t3x19">19</a> George Brecht, conceptual artist influenced
            by Zen and Dadaism explored the element of chance in
            art through his Water Yams and Word Event
            <a href="#3x20" class="refnote" name="t3x20">20</a>. Water
            Yams were boxed collections of cards with minimal textual instructions, after this many members of the Fluxus movement
            began to assemble works nestled in beautifully designed
            art boxes using innovative typography.</p>
        <p>When discussing Fluxus, I have to mention the legendary
            and enigmatic teacher, art theorist, conceptualist and performance
            artist Joseph Beuys, who was passionate about
            public debate, democracy and social sculptures
            <a href="#3x21" class="refnote" name="t3x21">21</a>. His
            democratic approach to art and teaching reminds me of
            the prophecy of the design medium democratization connected
            with surface production which is so current nowadays.
            When teaching he refused to follow university rules
            of restricted entry, so he welcomed anybody who wished
            to attend his classes.
            <a href="#3x22" class="refnote" name="t3x22">22</a> Beuys supported his students in
            getting rid of art boundaries. He was fascinated by speech
            and participation techniques of explaining things together
            with performative elements and philosophy.</p>
        <p>Another influential conceptual artist who connected performativity
        and semiotics is Joseph Kosuth, author of the
        famous piece One and Three Chairs<a href="#3x23" class="refnote" name="t3x23">23</a>
            dealing with various
        levels of abstraction: reality, representations, signs
        and definition or language. Through addressing experience
        including Aristotelian philosophy of spoken words,
        symbols and actual things Kosuth is closely connected to
        Derrida. In contradiction Beuys and Aristotle would see
        three chairs as one chair, but Derrida would probably describe
        them as three different chairs, or maybe even as
        three diverse texts.</p>

        <h1>Activism</h1>
        <p>During a lecture at the design conference Integrated I encountered
            the amazing and inspiring work of American nun,
            image‑
            maker and activist designer Sister Corita Kent. Over
            the many years she taught art in LA, she, in cooperation with
            her students, designed banners, books, costumes and silkscreen
            posters. She dynamically appropriated advertising
            techniques and the language of popular culture and emerging
            consumerism to passionately spread the message of
            love and peace.
            <a href="#3x24" class="refnote" name="t3x24">24</a>
            On top of that, Sister Corita was friends
            with many intellectuals of that time, among them John Cage,
            with whom she wrote and designed the famous Rules for
            Students and Teachers.
            <a href="#3x25" class="refnote" name="t3x25">25</a> These rules were brought to
            fame via The Whole Earth Catalog, an American alternative
            Do It Yourself culture magazine in 1968, the year Sister Corita
            passed away.</p>
        <p>Performers, activists and designers worthy of ending the
            third chapter are Dutch Provo. As described by Experimental
            Jet Set, The Provo was a playful anarchist movement,
            a collective of individuals with different ambitions: <em>“subversive
            agendas, artistic motives, utopian ideas, concrete
            plans.”</em> <a href="#3x26" class="refnote" name="t3x26">26</a>
            Provo, inspired by the anti‑
            authoritarian anti‑capitalist
            Situationists <a href="#3x27" class="refnote" name="t3x27">27</a> incorporated graphic design,
            ephemera with happenings and calls for social change
            during their short two year existence, 1965 - 1967.
            Part of Provo was also a political wing addressing social problems
            by proposing White Plans, to make Netherlands a more liveable
            place. The most famous of Provo's political plans is the
            White Bicycle Plan, that proposed improving public transport
            in central Amsterdam and the first public bike sharing
            system ever.<a href="#3x28" class="refnote" name="t3x28">28</a>
            So Provo produced surface as an activist
            tool during their happenings.</p>

            Duchamp claimed that he created
            his poster from a photograph of 20
            thrown cubes into the air. In 2004 R.
            R. Shearer and R. Slawinski tried to
            generate same photograph according
            to cube’s positions, surprisingly they
            made shocking discovery. Physical reality
            in Duchamp’s poster is a trick, because
            in order to co‑exist
            in one space, the cubes would interpenetrate into
            themselves and some of them would
            change their shape and became optical
            illusions. Duchamp developed his <em>“impossible
            figures”</em> before famous opart
            emerged in visual arts in 1950s.

        <h1>Commodified Performativity</h1>

        <p>The gear of technological development mounted in the
            late 20th century as an era of computers, satellites and
            nuclear power. While Marshall McLuhan was formulating
            ideas about shift of the media, famous pop artist and bohemian
            illustrator Andy Warhol emerged coincidently in
            New York. Warhol was a genius who found a relationship
            between celebrity life, art, graphics and commerce. He
            uniquely merged a mode of serial art production, advertising
            and performative aspects into his work. Compared to
            Duchamp’s discovery of performativity as a process of producing
            art, Warhol removed performativity (labour) from art
            production and commodified that. He added value to mass
            produced designs by removing valuable production of
            a surface from its unique relationship to the artist. He created
            mass produced graphic prints like in an average factory,
            but he added value through his performance. I would
            call this the first capitalistic art production
            <a href="#4x1" class="refnote" name="t4x1">1</a>
            .</p>

        <p>Warhol positioned himself as a brand and hid real labour
        behind the surface. Therefore an artist as single unique
        creator became obsolete. I perceive this as the first historic
        transfer of performativity from artist to designer.
        Nonetheless Warhol used several forms of performativity,
        he became a celebrity by creating a myth about himself,
        he shocked his audience through hoaxes and held
            controversial performances and art gatherings<a href="#4x2" class="refnote" name="t4x2">2</a>. Among
        that, Warhol pioneered computer‑
        generated graphic design
        and art on the Amiga a few years Amiga few years
        before he died.<a href="#4x3" class="refnote" name="t4x3">3</a></p>

        <p>In The Visual Event<a href="#4x4"class="refnote" name="t4x4">4</a>,
            a book emphasizing eventness in
            graphic design, editor Oliver KlimpeI refers to work of the
            late 70’s artist Guy de Cointet. Cointet was inspired by Duchamp
            and Warhol, fascinated by riddles, TV soap operas,
            cryptography, conceptual art, typography and language. He
            delicately mixed this all into his staged performances, where
            his actors discussed art surrounded by beautifully designed
            props, such as books, large single letters, posters and simply
            coloured strange objects. I understand his work as a very
            special moment, where graphic design and performance
            meet and work equally alongside of each other to affect
            their audience.</p>

        <h1>The Power of New Media</h1>

        <p> Lets move on to the 1980’s to discover the fascinating
            work of Korean‑
            born Fluxus artist, Nam June Paik,
            who transformed the electronic moving image, video,
            into an artist’s medium. His experiments seem to me as
            the ground where new media, performance and graphic
            signs merge together in incredible intermedial cooperation.
            I would like to introduce a few of his works, for example
            the Video Synthesizer able to change colours<a href="#4x5" class="refnote" name="t4x5">5</a>, the
            TV environment called Video Garden or the application
            of telecommunications in his Electronic Super Highway<a href="#4x6" class="refnote" name="t4x6">6</a>.
            From the graphic design point of view he explored
            signs and visual codes through his multiple TV screens.
            Paik’s work could be theorized as an active relation between
            signifier and signified, which is connected with Derrida’s
            postmodern crisis in representation.<a href="#4x7" class="refnote" name="t4x7">7</a></p>

        <p> Jenny Holzer is a conceptual artist, a digital poet partly
            following in the steps of Paik. Inspired by linguistic signs,
            minimal texts and symbols, she uses multimedia but also
            imitates the commercial language of graphic design to bring
            art into circulation. For example ironic and bitter statements
            applied to golf balls, coffee cups and other merchandise
            products as well as huge LED displays and projections<a href="#4x8" class="refnote" name="t4x8">8</a>.
            Holzer’s work welcomed a sort of a pathos until the 1990’s,
            when she began to be involved in more risky territory,displaying texts that addressed politics, war, rape and serious
            illnesses projected in and on public spaces. Holzer
            pushes viewers to interpret her texts and truisms<a href="#4x9" class="refnote" name="t4x9">9</a>, she
            creates performative space to activate the viewer through
            technologized typographic artworks.</p>

        <p>In the context of evolving technology and performance art
            there is a special artist to be mentioned, Stelarc, the robotic
            calligrapher. Revealing himself in the appearance of
            a cyborg who can write simultaneously with three hands,
            he shocked his audience, opened new ethic questions and
            showed that artists have power to push new technologies
            forward. In order to extend his obsolete body beyond its own
            limits he attached an extra robotic Third Hand to his body
            and wrote: “EVOLUTION” with it in 1988. He claims that the
            body is driven by a desire to transcend its evolutionary limitations<a href="#4x10" class="refnote" name="t4x10">10</a>.
            Stelarc is fascinated by utilizing his body as an
            object - a surface - inviting technology into coexistence for
            the very first time. When talking about the body as surface
            and the field for potential acts, I have to mention another
            extreme artist, Orlan, who actively redesigns her body following
            an ancient aesthetic canon. In my eyes her body, surviving
            many painful surgeries, became a mute surface.</p>

        <h1>New Millennium of Performance‑aware Designers</h1>

        <p><em>“Performance really is an attempt at synthesizing communication.
            It’s an attempt at a new communication. But the only people this art
            exists for are the people who are there. And it’s the only time the
            art exists.”</em> — Terry Fox<a href="#4x11" class="refnote" name="t4x11">11</a></p>
        <p>I understand this as Fox’s belief in performance and
            it’s power to create a new form of communication. Designers
            use communication, and manipulate it through their
            work,<a href="#4x12" class="refnote" name="t4x12">12</a>
            so it’s natural to see a connection between creation
            in performance and communication design.</p>
        <p>Talking about the body as a surface, a possible area for action,
            to put a message on, to communicate through, I have
            to introduce the gutsy New York based designer Stefan
            Sagmeister. Influenced by working at M&Co for the <em>“bad boy
            of graphic design”</em> Tilbor Kalman<a href="#4x13" class="refnote" name="t4x13">13</a>, a social activist and
            editor‑
            designer of Colors magazine, he started to communicate
            clients’ wishes with imaginative typography and self‑centric
            way. The best example uniting design and the body
            act would be his 1999 poster for an AGIA lecture, where he
            cut an entire invitation into his skin. Another performative
            as well as nomadic aspect could be found in his experimental
            years called Sabbaticals, which he use for relaxing and exploring the world.
            In 2008 he stacked ten thousand
            bananas which through their phase of age - while changing
            colour of their former surface from green to yellow to brown
            - formed up a sentence: <em>“Self‑confidence
            produces fine results.”</em></p>
        <p>  I met Stefan last year at AGIA London shortly before his talk
        about his Happiness project<a href="#4x14" class="refnote" name="t4x14">14</a>, which aims to positively
        activate the audience. So I have to admit, implementing performance
        and play into the design process, makes him an
        extraordinary designer.</p>

        <p>I would like to end this chapter with the surface‑
            driven
            performative practice of two selected Czech graphic designers,
            Petr Babák and Aleš Najbrt. Babák’s characteristic
            style is based on experiment and importance of chance
            during the process of creation and production of surface.
            As an example from his amazing oeuvre I’ve selected one
            of his recently digitized hybrid typefaces and its application.
            Řezan The Cutter typeface was cut out of solid paper
            using a razor blade what makes it a great demonstration
            of exaggeration and playfulness. But this unconventional
            typo‑
            game continued, in 2012 Babák designed a catalogue
            with it and created a special edition glued by asphalt,
            afterwards cut on a circular saw during its launch<a href="#4x15" class="refnote" name="t4x15">15</a>. Mute
            surface was “baptized by fire” during this performative ceremony.
            That’s why I consider Babák a master of communication
            involving viewers by decoded production practices
            and defamiliarization. His designs are oriented towards
            concept more than superficial aesthetic forms and styles.</p>

        <p>When I interviewed Babák about performance as a potential
        approach in conceptual graphic design, he admitted
        he liked to <em>“find another way to get our (his design studio’s)
        works into viewer’s awareness than just deliver a book to the
        bookstore shelves and wait ...”</em></p>

        <p>Mr. Najbrt, who despite owning a successful commercial
            design studio, practices performance inspired by late
            1980’s anti‑
            communist activism and performance. Under
            the name of Thomas and Ruhller (as a joke that refers to
            Tomas Ruller, performer and my father) Najbrt started ironic
            performances involving art formality and its appropriation
            as entertainment. He is interested in catching viewers’
            attention through provocation.
            <a href="#4x16" class="refnote" name="t4x16">16</a> For shows and a hoax
            world tour, he designed a special typeface and various
            printed matter. Therefore, following the merging of graphic
            design into the realm of performance, the case of Najbrt is
            quite interesting for my thesis.</p>

        <p><a name="4x1" href="#t4x1"><span class="notenumber">1&nbsp</a></span>Capitalistic in a manner of creating
            surplus value above artist’s labour,
            which is possessed and multiplied by
            the owner - the capitalist - not by the
            one who actually worked on it. I think
            Warhol found relation between performativity
            in society and object by practicing
            an opposite way than Duchamp.
            Duchamp was interested in displacing
            commercial object out of its context by
            performative act of singing it, consequently
            giving a value to it. On contrary
            Warhol used pop art and performative
            gestures to employ process of mass
            production - to create art with it.</p>
        <p><a name="4x2" href="#t4x2"><span class="notenumber">2&nbsp</a></span>Warhol organised series of complex
            events cummulating all what he liked
            called Exploding Plastic Inevitable in
            1966-67. These unique events were
            taken as an exploration platform for
            finding the new in art and music, included
            simultaneous multi‑screenings
            of his movies, concerts of Velvet
            Underground, lightworks and debates
            upon future of humankind. I consider
            Exploiting Plastic Inevitable events
            as revolutionary in extending media,
            social aspects and technological development.
            I would consider his 1967 Utah
            lecture as the best hoax and identity
            performance he ever created. Lecture
            became a shocking discovery by outraged
            audience. Because he feigned his
            own presence by hiring a bad actor to
            perform him. <em>“Warhol’s gesture serves
            as a premediated self‑portrait.
            This event
            is best described as performance. …
            Warhol’s self‑portraits
            construct multiple
            guises rather than reveal the true self.”</em>

            For his Exploration of Happiness,
            traveling exhibitions and movie entitled
            The Happy Film, Sagmeister used
            social media crowdsourcing, simple
            happy data visualisations and little
            playful tasks to activate his audience.
            Speaking about activation I should
            keenly think of the relation to affect. Affecting
            is influencing and Sagmeister is

            <p><em>“We live in a dynamic, data‑driven
                society that is continually sparking

                — Moniker<a href="#5x1" class="refnote" name="t5x1">1</a></p>
            <h1>Democratized Surface Production</h1>

            <p> Over 45 years of information technology has transformed
                performative surface production as well as our working patterns.
                In the post-1995 climate of extreme expansion of the
                Internet as well as diversity of softwares and apps caused
                many new things to become possible. Performance which
                was as a production strategy discovered by Duchamp for
                fine arts and extended by Cage, Fluxus and Warhol has now
                became part of everyday life. People produce thousands of
                surfaces to capture their actions or experience. Users take
                selfies and share personal data collected by various small
                wearable devices such as Google Glasses or Nike+ FuelBand
                bracelets and many other wearables.</p>

            <p>Alongside media evolution came the democratization of design<a href="#5x2" class="refnote" name="t5x2">2</a>.
                I understand it as new technologies enabling a wider
                unprofessional audience to access the process of creating.
                This is done through the availability of new tools. Especially
                through the mass usage of personal computers, home printers,
                Adobe Photoshop and increasing amounts of intuitive
                user friendly softwares supported by the tutorial boom.</p>

            <p>But when people use tools to transform physical and virtual
                materials, at the same time tools transform users, as it is
                nicely described in Andrew Blauvelt’s essay Tool (or Post‑Production
                for Graphic Designer). This particular transformation
                of design tools and designer’s milieu, caused a shift
                of the role; from designer‑
                translator, who provides a service
                by adjusting and interpreting content, to the designer‑
                editor,
                producer, researcher, programmer and hacker<a href="#5x3" class="refnote" name="t5x3">3</a>
                . However,
                the same questions remain: How to catch the viewer’s attention?
                Which instruments should the designer create to
                build relationships? How to construct a visual strategy that
                has the power to activate the audience? What kind of effect
                do I want to address?<a href="#5x4" class="refnote" name="t5x4">4</a></p>

            <p>The democratization of design according to Ellen Lupton
                <em>“offers designers a new crack at materialism, a chance to
            re‑engage
            the physical aspects of our work. Whereas the
            term ‘author,’ like ‘designer,’ suggests the cerebral workings
            of the mind, production privileges the activity of the body.
            Production is rooted in the material world. It values things
            over ideas, making over imagining, practice over theory.”</em><a href="#5x5" class="refnote" name="t5x5">5</a></p>

            <p>I doubt Lupton’s limited solution focused towards the territory
                of physical object production. I think this new engagement
                should also be extended towards a more immaterial
                mastery of informations and lastly to move into the realm of
                performativity to establish new connections, generate new
                relationships towards viewers, to involve them and to enrich
                the field of communication design.<a href="#5x6" class="refnote" name="t5x6">6</a> I assume performance,
                with its potential to generate new value, to be a possible
                approach to face the issue of democratization. That
                proposed extension of Lupton’s theory corresponds more
                with the aspects of active surfaces, as they are described in
                the first chapter.
            </p>

            <p>To demonstrate my arguments I’ve selected a few contemporary
            designers and performers who are active towards
            employing their skills within performative strategies to
            shape the user/viewer’s experience.  </p>

            <h1>Performative Ways of Production</h1>
            <p>Engaged in performance, studio Åbäke, is focused on self‑initiated
                projects deconstructing the conventions and
                processes of design.<a href="#5x7" class="refnote" name="t5x7">7</a> Their exhibition All The Knives connected
                performance and graphic design. Visitors were welcomed
                by hired performers‑
                storytellers. Exhibited ephemera
                and other printed graphic items catalysed personalized
                narratives. Åbäke curated this for one simple purpose - to
                make a survey of new forms of graphic medium presentation.
                Their Talk About Talks intrigued me as well. It was
                announced as a lecture, but rather it was a happening
                constructed upon previous talks, involving audience and
                chance.<a href="#5x8" class="refnote" name="t5x8">8</a>
                The audience was asked to set up smartphone
                alarms. It resulted in a few minutes long cacophony of ring
                tones among the lecture auditorium. I asked Maki Suzuki,
                member of Åbäke, about using performance in his talks
                and he explained that he enjoys that, because <em>“it’s more
                exciting to do rather than represent”</em>.</p>
            <p>Other designers incorporating performative acts into their
                works, talks and lectures are Belgian Ines Cox and Lauren
                Grusenmeyer. This duo is interested in creating graphic design
                discourse by involving staging, dialogues, costumes
                and graphic identities. Cox & Grusenmeyer critically and
                playfully personalize their acts aiming to activate the audience
                or open social, educational and political issues.</p>
            <p>I’ve seen documentation of their Citizen Speech happening,
                appropriating the marketing techniques of political gatherings.
                By fictional scenario of dystopian unified America and
                China it criticized ideology and investigated <em>“how the political
                theater is strictly directed with designed gestures, clothing
                and accessories.”</em><a href="#5x9" class="refnote" name="t5x9">9</a>
                The event happened in the form of
                a presidential speech, accompanied and supported by designed
                props with empty slogans and encouraging panels.
                This design experiment reminds me of Austin’s speech acts,
                described in the first chapter.</p>
            <p> There is a list of very special tags on their website, for example
                <em>“blablabla”</em>, <em>“participation”</em>, <em>“remonstrance”</em>,<em> “action
            reaction”</em> or <em>“masquerade”</em> which all have a strong relationship
            to performance and surface production. For example
            the series The Cox & Grusenmeyer University are events
            where the <em>“performance is a complete design in which both
            the inscenation as the character, attributes and gestures
            are designed in the format of a university.”</em>
                <a href="#5x10" class="refnote" name="t5x10">10</a> Designers appear
            here as professors equipped by markers, badges with
            C&G University logo and theoretical textbooks. The textbook
            then remains as a souvenir of the happening. Another example
            would be their Brush Factory event, a ritual to initiate
            new art students into their careers. Participants were asked
            to fill in a form and contract according to which a unique personalized paint brush was created from their own hair.
                This illustrates how Cox & Grusenmeyer brilliantly unify performative
                acts with graphic design to create ephemeral surfaces
                and unforgettable events. </p>

            <p>The next example of working with printed matter during
                and for happening would be the work of art activist duo The
                Yes Men. Through various acts they wish to achieve public
                awareness of many economic, political and social issues.
                One may ask, so how do they do that? Then my answer
                would be, by exposing the truth about the world through
                ridiculous caricatures, total fakes and hoaxes. To target a
                larger audience they use mass media - TV, newspapers,
                websites. In The New York Times project<a href="#5x11" class="refnote" name="t5x11">11</a> they spread
                newspaper large‑
                scale, containing only positive news under
                the title <em>“All the News We Hope to Print”</em> altering the real
                motto of the NYT: <em>“All the News That’s Fit to Print”.</em> They
                worked on that one particular issue for 9 months. Around
                80,000 copies were handed out in American cities proclaiming
                that the Iraq War Ended, oil corporations started to
                fund climate change efforts and USA established a new better
                national health care system<a href="#5x12" class="refnote" name="t5x12">12</a>.</p>
            <p>The next illustration of questioning contemporary means of
                production by exposing it to performative circumstances
                would be what Dutch art platform iii calls Self‑
                made media. iii
                claims that such media becomes autonomous when created
                through experimentation and combining skills from different
                fields, including visual art, music and philosophy.<a href="#5x13" class="refnote" name="t5x13">13</a> I have
                found their interdisciplinary research fascinating. It helps
                expanding cultural fields through alternative and synthetic
                methods. I interviewed iii member, Matteo Maragoni about
                his latest project No Patent Pending: Self made Performative
                Media.<a href="#5x14" class="refnote" name="t5x14">14</a> Each page of this publication consists of a single
                card containing a variety of contributions on the topic of contemporary
                cross‑media
                performance. However, the cards
                were randomly shuffled during the collective performance
                and the reader had to assemble his own book. Matteo emphasized
                the importance of chance in the performative process.
                Chance - the potential of everything that can happen,
                maybe even a mistake, is what makes performance unique
                besides the relationship between audience and performer.
                This reminds me of what Bruno Listopad talked about (in the
                first chapter). Chance and randomness transform the average
                medium of print into the performative artefact.</p>
            <p>While thinking about process it’s the right moment to mention
                the performative calligraphic practice of Job Wouters - known as
                Letman. He is inspired by the suggestive power of language, text
                and typography - especially in a form of amateur street design.
                Letman’s handwriting practice breaks super‑carefulness
                of formalist typography while often performed as live
                shows<a href="#5x15" class="refnote" name="t5x15">15</a>. I perceive
                this particular synthesis of performance as a craftsmanship. Job is
                a craftsman who adds special unique value to his designs through
                the performance. In my opinion, craftsmanship without performativity
                is worthless.</p>

            <h1>Happening in Design, Design in Happening</h1>
            <p>Amsterdam based design studio Moniker uses happening
                to generate surface. By various performative and interactive
                projects mainly focused on process Moniker explores <em>“how
                we use technology and how it influences our daily lives.”</em>
                <a href="#5x16" class="refnote" name="t5x16">16</a>
                Designers Luna Maurer, Roel Wouters and Jonathan Puckey
                are also founders of playful design methods that harness
                creative acts with simple tasks called Conditional Design
                <a href="#5x17" class="refnote" name="t5x17">17</a>
                This method is based on experimenting out of the media‑restricted
                world and on an easily adoptable DIY setup.
                To manifest their exciting creative system Moniker released
                the Conditional Design Workbook, designed by Julia Born.
                The workbook contains several essays, a glossary and 10
                complete workshop rules. Moniker explain their activities
                as a <em>“play with instructions, taking turns, participation and
                interaction.”</em><a href="#5x18" class="refnote" name="t5x18">18</a></p>
            <p>Alongside this remarkable method there are other key
                projects linking performance with surface. In The Skeuo
                Office video Moniker presents offices of the future from
                a bird’s eye view. What makes it special for my thesis research
                is, that it shows a new form of generic skeumorph
                <a href="#5x19" class="refnote" name="t5x19">19</a>
                surface, which could be changed by its inhabitants - in this
                case by office people. But how do they change the office
                style when the whole room is one big active surface? Instead
                of swiping, because there is no device to swipe on,
                employees simply jump to redesign the office. But why
                does Moniker propose such a system? The answer is that
                nowadays people are used to everything being open for
                possibilities and personalization. Social media profiles are
                the best examples. How Moniker shows the contemporary
                user’s need of synchronizing surroundings with performed
                occupation seems like a brilliant idea to me, which is very
                close to the reality of future surfaces.</p>
            <p>In 2013 I became part of a crowd‑
                sourced music video Do
                Not Touch. An extraordinary mix of user experience through
                storytelling, simplicity and fun. Users aren’t passive anymore
                like they are described in The Society of the Spectacle
                by Guy Debord
                <a href="#5x20" class="refnote" name="t5x20">20</a>,
                they are stimulated and directly asked for
                action while watching Moniker’s videoclip.</p>
            <p>Viewers are guided through the video by easy tasks, that
            they may follow with their cursor. Cursor data is recorded
            and integrated into the video. Especially intriguing is that the
            viewer isn’t alone during completing these prompts, there
            are hundreds of other cursors. This is an excellent example
            of how online happening - a collective performance with
            non‑
            professionals - produces a non-stop active surface, always
            open to potential.</p>

            <h1>Post‑representational
                Paradigm and Crisis of Identity</h1>
            <p>Berlin based artist and cultural critic Hito Steyerl questions
                the proliferation of media in capitalism and globalization.
                She emphasizes a post‑
                representational paradigm
                of contemporary visual art explained through active
                surfaces: <em>“We might think that the phone sees what we
                want, but actually we will see what the phone thinks it
                knows about us.“</em>
                <a href="#5x21" class="refnote" name="t5x21">21</a></p>
            <p> I understand the term post‑
                representational as how
                smart software interprets user data. Among other interesting
                things Hito Steyerl is an author of a cultural theory
                called Circulationism, which I consider as art of post‑production
                and acceleration of new, old and appropriated
                images. Steyerl is captivated by contemporary identity,
                which she defines as an informational, pictorial and genetic
                battlefield over owner’s code. This war rages on the
                surface of physical but also virtual bodies. I think that all
                users - we - should be aware of this, especially in a time
                when social media create a zone of voyeurism, mass‑control
                and profit from data mining.
            </p>
            <p>
                The artistic video called How Not to be Seen: A Fucking
                Didactic Educational .MOV File is Steyerl’s masterpiece
                from 2013 depicting all her post‑
                representational identity
                concerns. In her works she desires to inform viewers how
                to disappear from social media bots using smart algorithms.
                Thus she surrounds herself by photo‑
                calibrating
                targets while her companions wear green key suits to became
                techno‑
                ghosts. In her oeuvre she performs, reflects
                and uses surface as a tool and field of potential.
            </p>
            <p>Thinking about Steyerl’s work, pointing out post‑
                representation through accenting an escape from algorithms led
                me to do a little research on a common popular performative
                social practice - the selfie. Users are stimulated by this
                mania to upload many self‑
                captured images. The benefit
                from being social and are showing users from their best
                angles hides a thread. Their data can be easily abused
                and monitored. I imagine user profiles as windows to intimate
                lives, therefore the data they contain might be stored
                as a source of commercial information of the capitalist
                market.</p>
            <p>All users are, at least for a while, performing their better
                selves to create a part of the active surface of social networks.
                The best example of design work focused on this
                specific topic is Optical Illusion Selfies webcam filters set
                by Pinar&Viola. Project explores everyday digital gestures
                and the persona.<a href="#5x22" class="refnote" name="t5x22">22</a> Every user is a performer.</p>
            <p>The last example in this thesis is Auto Italia, an artist organisation
                focused on artificial identity and the relationship
                of art within mainstream media. In the interactive
                teaser Meet Z<a href="#5x23" class="refnote" name="t5x23">23</a> the visitor is guided by a virtual girl, an
                automated online assistant through an active surface full
                of spam and branding.</p>
            <p> The visitor enters a stunning visual space for exploration
                where she/he is several times challenged to scroll through
                the narrative exploring future of lifestyle, leisure activities
                and possible work spaces. The visitor becomes active -
                a user who controls her/his experience. Auto Italia is my last
                example of contemporary performative practice working
                with the relationships between identity, surface production
                and theorisation.

                Debord’s Society of Spectacle is an inside in
                to the social life of that time (1967) and decline
                of authenticity transformed into the representation.
                I understand the spectacle as false passive
                relation to commercialized and mediated
                appearings or images. Principle of Spectacle
                is never enough of consumption in capitalized
                world. In his 17th thesis Debord described that
                the effect of <em>“economy’s domination of social
                life brought about an evident degradation of
                being into having — human fulfillment was no
                longer equated with what one was, but with what
                one possessed. The present stage, in which social
                life has become completely dominated by
                the accumulated productions of the economy,
                is bringing about a general shift from having to.”</em>

                Example could be photographical sensor
                capturing data in form of a noise - not recognizable
                and not detectable mixture of pixels.
                But nowadays especially when online, uploaded
                photographies undergo smart processes.
                Various algorithms go through the visual information
                - the noise - clean it and find a definition
                to it. These algorithms are smart, they scan all
                other photos from users phones via Facebook
                or Instagram profiles. They look at previously
                made tagged images, recognize user, his/
                her friends and needs. Then it, in my opinion,
                disrespectfully interprets the data and offers
                what it thinks the user might like to see or buy.

            <h1>Rethinking Surface Production<br>
                in Terms of Performance</h1>

            <p>Even though it is not obvious and sometimes not specific,
                the strategy of becoming a performer isn’t only a fine arts
                privilege nowadays. The Performative turn of the 1960’s indicated
                not only an art‑
                revolt but also the birth of a new form
                of labour - general performance. Besides the known roles of
                graphic designers as service providers, editors, translators,
                researchers, autonomous creators and system engineers
                – graphic designers have adopted the role of performers.
                Although the typical result of a graphic designer’s labour is
                surface, designers are more and more involved in actions,
                happenings and events. They use their virtual/bodily presence
                and actions to give value to their labour.</p>

            <p> Another way performance is presented in graphic design
                is craftsmanship. The value of contemporary craft labour is
                produced by the presence or the notion of craftsmen’s body.
                Surface production is more and more oriented towards actions,
                happenings and events to catch the viewers attention
                and generate value. Crafted surface without the action of
                designer‑
                performer would have merely the value of print.</p>

            <p> From another point of view, the viewer’s action is a key element
                in the re‑
                production of active surface. Information is
                no longer trapped in books, narratives and images, rather
                they circulate independently in networks. Therefore information
                no longer exists as a static media, they are processes,
                connections, interactions, impulses or options.</p>

            <p>Representing reality isn’t important for us, we rather post‑produce
                and in Deleuzian terms re‑
                territorialize it through
                millions of tiny interactions. As a result we, designers, talk
                more frequently about performativity, experience and event
                than about the image or text.</p>

            <p>If graphic design competes for the viewer’s attention and
                performance with its power to affect increases attractiveness,
                than involvement of an action and the body into design
                makes sense. Graphic design is no longer limited by being
                only an object‑
                driven practice, the new value could be found
                in its eventness.
